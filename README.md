<b><u>Project Description</u></b>

I wrote the projects in this repository during a course I took in June/July of 2024 on AI and Machine Learning. The course focused on an understanding of the mathematical theory behind different data analytic tools, especially focusing on regression and the stastical analysis that underpins neural networks. This theory was then applied in the form of five projects each of which covered a different type of regression or neural network. The final project, named "Combined CNN and RNN sentiment analysis", was the culmination of all of this work where I built a neural network that could analyse the text and image data within a tweet simultaenously and deduce the associated emotion.

This was my introduction to many machine learning concepts, where I first used libraries such as: TensorFlow, PyTorch and scikit-learn.
