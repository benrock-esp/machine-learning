Project Description

The projects in this repository correspond to a course taken in June/July of 2024 on AI and Machine Learning. The course focused on an understanding of the mathematical theory behind different data analytic tools, especially focusing on regression, and the stastical analysis that underpins neural networks. This theory was then applied in the form of five projects which each covered a different type of regression or neural network. The final project, named Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis, was the culmination of all of this work and aimed to build a neural network that could analyse the text and image data within a tweet simultaenously and deduce the associated emtion.
